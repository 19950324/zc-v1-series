Zen Cart&reg; - The Art of E-Commerce
===============

Zen Cart v1.5.0
---------------
Zen Cart v1.5.0 is the first Open Source e-Commerce web application to be fully PA-DSS Certified.


Installation
------------

Installation is simple:

1. [Download Zen Cart](http://sourceforge.net/projects/zencart/files)
2. Unzip the downloaded zip file 
3. Everything inside the folder you unzipped needs to be uploaded to your webserver â€¦ for example, into your public_html or www or html folder (the folder will already exist on your webserver)
4. In your browser, enter the address to your site, such as: www.your_site.com (or if you uploaded it into another foldername use www.your_site.com/foldername)
5. Rename the /includes/dist-configure.php and /admin/includes/dist-configure.php files to just "configure.php" and make the files writable.
Also make the /cache/ folder writable. (You will be prompted about making other folders writable during installation)
6. Follow the instructions that appear for installation. 

That's the abbreviated version of installation instructions!
