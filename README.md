Zen Cart&reg; - The Art of E-Commerce
===============

Zen Cart&reg; v1.5.0
---------------
Zen Cart&reg; v1.5.0 is the first Open Source e-Commerce web application to be fully PA-DSS Certified.


Installation
------------

Installation is simple:

1. [Download Zen Cart&reg;](http://sourceforge.net/projects/zencart/files) or [From Github](https://github.com/zencart/zc-v15/zipball/master)
2. Ensure you check that the md5/sha1 hash of the Zip matches those publically posted.
  * The md5/sha1 values for Github are displayed in the projects [description](https://github.com/zencart/zc-v15)
  * The md5/sha1 values for the zip files hosted at sourceforge are displayed on at the Zen Cart&reg; [website](http://www.zen-cart.com/)
3. Unzip the downloaded zip file 
4. Everything inside the folder you unzipped needs to be uploaded to your webserver â€¦ for example, into your public_html or www or html folder (the folder will already exist on your webserver)
5. In your browser, enter the address to your site, such as: www.your_site.com (or if you uploaded it into another foldername use www.your_site.com/foldername)
6. Rename the /includes/dist-configure.php and /admin/includes/dist-configure.php files to just "configure.php" and make the files writable.
7. Also make the /cache/ folder writable. (You will be prompted about making other folders writable during installation)
8. Follow the instructions that appear for installation. 

That's the abbreviated version of installation instructions!

For a MUCH more detailed set of installation instructions, see the [/docs/1.readme_installation.html](http://www.zen-cart.net/docs/1.readme_installation.html) file in your Zen Cart files.

PCI Compliance
--------------
Currently only the v1.5.0 release is PA-DSS ceritified. On Github this is currenlty represented by the master and v150-release branches, and only when you download those branches as Zip files.
Other branches are not PA-DSS Certified unless otherwise stated.
 
__The [/docs/implementation-guide.pdf](http://www.zen-cart.net/docs/index.html) should be followed for PCI Compliant implementation.__
